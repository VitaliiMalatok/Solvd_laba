The iPhone is a line of smartphones designed and marketed by Apple Inc. these devices
use Apple's iOS mobile operating system. The first-generation iPhone was announced by
then-Apple CEO Steve Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, Apple has annually released
new iPhone models and iOS updates. As of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion
iPhones had been sold.

The iPhone has a user interface built around a multi-touch screen. It connects to cellular
networks or Wi-Fi, and can make calls, browse the web, take pictures, play music and send
and receive emails and text messages. Since the iPhone's launch further features have been
added, including larger screen sizes, shooting video, waterproofing, the ability to install
third-party mobile apps through an app store, and many accessibility features. Up to iPhone
8 and 8 Plus, iPhones used a layout with a single button on the front panel that returns
the user to the home screen. Since iPhone X, iPhone models have switched to a nearly bezel-less
front screen design with app switching activated by gesture recognition.
